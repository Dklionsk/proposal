Each part of the poem hints at an object in the solar system, all moons and planets with one exception. The first letters of each object spell out the answer, EVERNOTE.

My winding garden path began
At the pale blue dot from which I'd roam.
All who ever lived and died
Have called this place their home.
(Carl Sagan's "pale blue dot" is Earth)

I came upon a flower,
Though not your ordinary bud:
This one has a taste for flesh
And feeds on insect blood.
(Venus flytrap)

It's colder here, and a layer of ice
Hides an ocean deep below.
I wonder if life is hiding there,
Swimming to and fro.
(Jupiter's moon Europa, whose oceans are thought to possibly contain life)

Though she is small, her role is great
And her ringed parent won't let her loose.
She even has small rings of her own,
Befitting a mother of Zeus.
(Rhea, one of Saturn's moons, and Mother of Zeus in mythology)

Farther than I'd been before, 
I encountered another god,
Who showed off to me his trident,
A beauty I must applaud.
(Neptune, god of the sea who holds a trident)

Far, far from the garden now,
I began to wade through an icy dust
Its existence I thought was hypothetical
But acknowledge it now we must.
(The Oort cloud, a hypothetica cloud of comets around the solar system)

With nothing in the distance I reversed my course
And met a friend who I had long since not seen.
I first met her in a reverie on a midsummer night,
When the fairies called her queen.
(Titania, moon of Uranus, queen of the fairies in A Midsummer Night's Dream)

My friend told me of her newest acquaintance,
Undiscovered until nearly ten years ago.
She's a dwarf compared to her more popular companions,
And long hidden behind another rock of snow.
(Eris, a dwarf planet beyond Pluto, discovered in 2005)
