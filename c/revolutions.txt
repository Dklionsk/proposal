My winding garden path began
At the pale blue dot from which I'd roam.
All who ever lived and died
Have called this little place their home.

I came upon a flower,
Though not your ordinary bud:
This one has a taste for flesh
And feeds on insect blood.

It's colder here, and a layer of ice
Hides an ocean deep below.
I wonder if life is hiding there,
Swimming to and fro.

Though she is small, her role is great
And her ringed parent won't let her loose.
She even has small rings of her own,
Only befitting a mother of Zeus.

Farther than I'd been before,
I encountered another god,
Who showed off to me his trident,
A beauty I must applaud.

Far, far from the garden now,
I began to wade through an icy dust
Its existence I thought was hypothetical
But acknowledge it now I must.

With nothing in the distance I reversed my course
And met a friend who I had long since not seen.
I first met her in a reverie on a midsummer night,
When the fairies called her queen.

My friend told me of her newest acquaintance,
Undiscovered until nearly ten years ago.
She's a dwarf compared to her more popular companions,
And long hidden behind another rock of snow.
